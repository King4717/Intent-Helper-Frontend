# Intent Helper Frontend

## 🚀 Overview
A prototype frontend that demonstrates how **intent-centric design** can make blockchain actions simple and user-friendly.

## ✨ Features
- Natural language input for user intents
- Parsed preview of detected action (mocked logic for now)
- One-click confirmation flow
- History of past intents

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- React.js
- TailwindCSS
- (Future) Backend intent parser + Anoma integration

## ▶️ Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/intent-helper-frontend.git
cd intent-helper-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---
Currently parsing logic is mocked in frontend, but repo is structured for easy future integration with real intent parser APIs.
